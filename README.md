# Tool and Dataset Release
An implementation of the proposed attack analysis framework is released, including all essential components for parsing execution traces, retrieving relevant security knowledge, and generating structured reports.

Alongside the tool, we provide a dataset of real-world smart contract exploits and the corresponding contract code to support replication and future research.

The data folder contains the source code and transaction traces related to attack incidents.
The code folder contains the core modules of the analysis tool.
