# Tool and Dataset Release
An implementation of the proposed attack analysis framework is made available, including all necessary components for parsing execution traces, retrieving relevant security knowledge, and generating structured reports. 

Alongside the tool, a dataset of real-world smart contract exploits and corresponding contract code is provided to support replication and future research.
